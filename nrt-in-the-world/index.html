                <h2>Faster Decision-making</h2>
                <p>The National Reporting Toolkit is an online platform that speeds up the analysis and reporting of environmental data. In doing so, accurate information reaches decision-makers faster, facilitating swift and effective action to reduce environmental degradation. </p>
                <h2>Reducing ‘Reporting Burden’ and Facilitating Regional and Global Assessments</h2>
                <p>To provide data to regional and global scale processes, parties on both sides have to spend time and effort writing and completing report templates, in order to build larger datasets and undertake more far-reaching assessments. Our goal with NRT is reduce this reporting workload by coordinating multiple NRT instances.</p>
                <p>Currently, NRT focuses on the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi, but this year it shall expand across the United Arab Emirates, and then beyond. Through seamlessly integrated data APIs, it will be much easier to aggregate the information in these multiple NRT instances at a regional and global level.</p>
                <p>Significant time and effort savings for countries and regional and global level actors can then be made as the process of sharing accurate, comparable information is hastened. In particular, NRT has many links to UNEP-Live, a project to transform the way the environment is monitored and reported on at a range of scales. <a href="http://www.uneplive.org/" target="_blank">Have a look at UNEP-Live for yourself here</a>.</p>
